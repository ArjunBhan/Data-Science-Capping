### Running

The following files from the ```./api/savedModels``` folder must be uploaded

MinMaxScaler.pkl

OneHotEncoder.pkl

neuralNet.h5

my-checkpoints.zip

Note my-checkpoints.zip must be created by zipping the ```./api/savedModels/my-checkpoints``` folder.

Then after these files are uploaded it should be as simple as running the notebook.
